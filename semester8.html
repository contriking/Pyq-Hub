                Upon successful completion of Physics-I course; the main objective of the students will be to: Develop
                basic concepts of mechanics, optics and its application od electricity and magnetism. 2. Demonstrate
                qualitative understanding of concepts of quantum physics and statistical mechanics. <br>
                3. Express their ability to identify and apply the appropriate analytic, numerical, computational and
                other mathematical tools necessary to solve physics problems. <br>
                4. Exhibit competence in the physics laboratory, including knowledge of advanced level physics and the
                ability to work independently.
